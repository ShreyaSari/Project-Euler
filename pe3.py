# Complexity Analysis
# 1.	Time Complexity:
# o	Dividing by 2 repeatedly is O(log‚Å°n)O(\log n)O(logn).
# o	Checking odd factors up to n\sqrt{n}n is approximately O(n)O(\sqrt{n})O(n).
# o	Total complexity: O(n)O(\sqrt{n})O(n).
# 2.	Space Complexity:
# o	Only a few variables are used, so the space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).
